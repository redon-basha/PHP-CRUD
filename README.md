# PHP-CRUD
A simple CRUD system using PHP and SQL where the user can manage projects.

There are two types of users: 
- The first one is the admin user that can add or delete other users and also can manage projects by creating or deleting them as well as viewing, adding or deleting the users that are participating in that project.
- The second one is the simple user that can manage only the projects that he is participating, but can create other projects as well.
